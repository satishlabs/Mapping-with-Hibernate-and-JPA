** make relationships between objects in JAVA. In JAVA, association of objects is very simple : we use a class’s attribute (variable) to do so.

// Factory class
  public class Factory {
    …
    // Factory can make product
    private Product product;
    …
  }
// Product class
  public class Product {
    …
    private String productName;
    …
  }
